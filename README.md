**Status**
* antlr2 contains a functioning Ada2005 grammar with a few elements of [Ada2012](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-P.html)
* antlr3 is a project to port the antlr2 grammar to [ANTLR](https://www.antlr3.org) version [3](https://github.com/antlr/antlr3) (not yet usable).
* antlr4 is a direct translation of the [Ada202x draft grammar](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xrm/html/RM-P.html) to [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org)-[4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). Providing C++ target support is being looked at.
